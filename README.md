<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
This project started with the motivation of learning web automation further and scraping with Python.</br>
After succesfully creating a bot that could:</br>

* Open a browser
* Login to Tinder.com
* Accept all notifications and dismiss pop-ups
* Swiping right or left 
* Scraping data of the profiles displayed, including, yet not limited to, name, age, bio, images, ...
* Sending personlized messages to your matches
* Sending you social media cards, like Instagram, Snapchat, Phonenumber and Facebook
* Sending GIFS and songs
* Unmatching

I decided to add some data analysis and plotting of data to the project. Star this project to keep up to date! :)
