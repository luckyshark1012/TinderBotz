# Usage of Tinderbot

For now, 
1. Open the [quickstart_tinderbot.py](https://github.com/frederikme/TinderBot/blob/master/quickstart_tinderbot.py) from the tinderbot directory.
2. Fill in your credentials (email and password) to be able to login to Tinder.
3. Change the quickstart script to your needs.

If you want to scrape as much profiles as possible,</br>
then [scraper.py](https://github.com/frederikme/TinderBot/blob/master/scraper.py) will be suiting your needs better.
